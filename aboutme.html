<h3> Reflection </h3>
Some similarities between python and scratch are that they both programs people use for coding and they both allow you to make things, but their codes are different and the way you work it. For python, the codes are more complex(I feel) and it's a much more advanced version compared to Scratch. In both, You can create loops which shortens your code and makes everything easier to look at, ask questions, and create different shapes.
Today, when we had to debug our program, I felt frustrated when I couldn't get exactly what I wanted. I was very determined to get it and when I did, it felt great which is what I liked about it. I felt satisfied after I finally completed it and even though it was frustrating throughout the way, I liked that it was challenging. I enjoyed how it wasn't boring and that we had to think a lot because it's worth it when you finally achieve it.


About Me: What You Don't Know
My name is Jessie and I am a junior at Bishop George Ahr High School. I have 3 other siblings and I'm the youngest. I live in New Jersey and my birthday is October 11, 2000(yes, I'm a libra!)I have a strong love for R&B music. A fun fact about me is that I used to have an OBESSESSION with One Direction. Like, when I say obession, I'm not sugarcoating it. I went to at least five of their concerts and I have no regrets at all. Also,  I like listening to music (there isn't a time when I don't have earbuds in...,) food, and also hanging out with my friends and doing new things. I dislike revolving doors, the sound of nails on a chalkboard, and kiwi fruit.
