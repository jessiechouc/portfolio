  <p> About Me: What You Don't Know! </p>
  My name is Jessie and I am a junior at Bishop George Ahr High School. I have 3 other siblings and I'm the youngest. I live in New Jersey and my birthday is October 11, 2000(yes, I'm a libra!)I have a strong love for R&B music. A fun fact about me is that I used to have an OBESSESSION with One Direction. Like, when I say obession, I'm not sugarcoating it. I went to at least five of their concerts and I have no regrets at all. Also,  I like listening to music (there isn't a time when I don't have earbuds in...,) food, and also hanging out with my friends and doing new things. I dislike revolving doors, the sound of nails on a chalkboard, and kiwi fruit.
